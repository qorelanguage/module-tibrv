tibrv module for Qore
version 0.1 by David Nichols

The "tibrv" module provides direct TIBCO Rendezvous(R) support, allowing qore programs to send and receive Rendezvous messages directly.

Requires qore 0.7.0 and TIBCO Rendezvous(R) headers and libraries to build.
Note that the TIBCO C++ library (libtibrvcpp.a or libtibrvcpp64.a) must be built with the same C++ compiler that is used to build the qore library and this module.

TIBCO Rendezvous(R) is a registered copyright of TIBCO, Inc.

Documentation TBA.

test/example script: test/tibrv-test.q

Set the RV_ROOT environment variable to the Rendezvous directory before calling configure (or use the --with-tibrv configure option) to build the "tibrv" module for direct Rendezvous support.

Note that to build this module the libtibrvcpp library must be present; on some platforms you have to rebuild this yourself from the sources provided by TIBCO in order for it to link with the C++ compiler you are using - the sources are normally present in $RV_ROOT/src/librvcpp, normally you have to edit the Makefile provided there and then type "make" to rebuild.  I had to include "ranlib libtibrvcpp.a" on the libraries I rebuilt for OS X.  Secure daemon support is turned off by default in tibrvcpp, to enable secure daemon support edit $RV_ROOT/src/librvcpp/Makefile and uncomment the SD_MODULE line near the end of the file, rebuild, install the new library in $RV_ROOT/lib, and rerun qore's configure script.

BUILD AND INSTALL
-----------------

configure
make
sudo make install

The configure script will find out where your qore module directory is found and set this for the install directory.

BUILD FROM SVN
--------------

reconf.sh
configure
make
sudo make install
